# __So Why IT?__

One of main reasons that i chose to switch into IT was that of the oppertunities that i has coming up into the future. Everything that we use in our daily lives based on something that is powered by a computer of some sort of technology and if not then it is slowly turning to the tech side over time.

## __What i want to get of taking IT courses.__

One of the options that IT has to offer is _Cyber Security_. The Air Force has always been a thought in my mind that i want to go into but i want to get my degree before so that i have more opertunity's that may pop up before i were to go in. __Cyber Security__ is becoming one of the biggest jobs and needs that the Airforce needs and i it seem right up my alley to do.
